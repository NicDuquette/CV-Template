# CV-Template

 This is a CV template in LaTeX. It is very close to my current CV, though with
 code comments intended for other people, and some other tidying changes.

 Suggestions for improvement are welcome. Should any of this be
 original enough and complicated enough to constitute an idea that could be
 protected by intellectual property law, I hereby put that idea in the public
 domain.
